## Achievements

Local Help People - http://ajudalocal.me/
This project consists of helping people, knowing where each homeless person is, who needs food, who needs books, who needs help, hygiene products, or psychological help and so on. API: https://github.com/frf/api.ajudalocal.me Frontend: https://github.com/frf/app.ajudalocal

Docfacil - https://docfacil.me 
Docfacil.me is a platform for sending documents such as ID, CPF, health insurance card, etc. .. This platform works with a simple upload of an image taken from the application, this image is saved encrypted on our server where only the owner himself has access. This idea came from a difficulty I saw that some elderly people need digitally some of their documents and did not find them, so the mobile app will concentrate all your documents.
